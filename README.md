# Cloud Native Workshop
Explore Cloud Native technologies like Kubernetes and Helm.

## Labs

### Getting Started

1. In your browser open Azure Cloud Shell by navigating to https://shell.azure.com.

    > You will use Azure Cloud Shell for all labs in this workshop. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/using-the-shell-window) for some tips and tricks (like how to *copy* and *paste*).

2. Check which subscription you have connected to:

    ```bash
    az account show
    ```

3. If you prefer, you can switch to a different subscription:

    ```bash
    az account set --subscription <subscription-name>
    ```

4. Within Cloud Shell, run the following command to download and execute the setup script:

    ```bash
    bash <(curl -Ls https://aka.ms/cloud-native-workshop/setup-script)
    cd ~/cnw
    ```
